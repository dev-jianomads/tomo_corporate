## ðŸš€ Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## ðŸ§­ Git workflow

For quick updates directly to `main`:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Describe your change"
git push origin main
```

For a feature branch and pull request flow:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-change
git add -A
git commit -m "Describe your change"
git push -u origin feature/my-change
# open a PR to main in GitHub
```

Note: If Netlify is configured to deploy from `main`, pushing to `main` triggers a new deploy.

## ðŸ“¦ Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to Netlify at: https://merry-crumble-d6b196.netlify.app

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Inspiration

Drawing inspiration from industry-leading companies like Apple, Linear, and Stripe, this design prioritizes:
- Clarity over complexity
- Function over decoration  
- User needs over business goals
- Authentic content over stock imagery
